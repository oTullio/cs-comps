0->1
Found in html comments:
<!--The password for natas1 is g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6 -->

1->2
Also html comments (inspect tool)
<!--The password for natas2 is h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7 -->

2->3
Follow the /files/image to /files ot see a list!
Then there's a users file containing natas3:G6ctbMJ5Nb4cbFwhpMPSvxGHhQ7I6W8Q

3->4
The hint in the comments on the page says "not even Google can find it," so viewing
robots.txt gave us the hint to go to /s3cr3t/ where a users file was found with
natas4 : tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm

4->5
Site says we need to come from natas5, so I installed an http referrer modifier
from the chrome web store which allowed me to spoof my referrer to natas5.
// ah you can also use burpsuite

5->6



Burpsuite captures the request from my browser and doesn't yet send it along
Burpsuite listens on port 8080 as a proxy

<?php 
    echo "Hello there";
?> // the OUTPUT of this PROGRAM (to stdout) goes to the client; you don't see the code you see the output
   // Unless you forgot to configure your server properly in which case it just sends it as a text file

// php always (probably) hashes arrays, it usually doesn't allocate contiguous space
// A lot of the hacker's job is to guess what the php looks like and try to subvert it in that way
