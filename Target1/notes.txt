nebuchadnezzar (on our other computer):

Open a virtual machine -> target1.ovf
Launched! 
Whaa! Primary IP address: Network information not available

Internet access works though
terminal: ip addr - 192.168.198.132


nebuchadnezzar (again):
Import vmdk instructions
error: attempt to read or write outsdie of disk 'hd0'
Same errors as above when attempting Migranes install
From VMWare: "Install Ubuntu as you would on a physical computer. When you are done and the operating systyem boots up, click "I finished installing" 

- followed instruction on how to import VM from .vmdk files
- after "Use an existing virtual disk" step, choose keep existing format
- the VM is running, login with slab/slab
- config .yaml file and reboot
- can not login with slab/slab. Ubuntu on this VM doesn't take in any input.
- suspect the server might be running, even though we can't login.
- tried host scan (nmap -sn 172.16.41.0/24)
	- Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-26 12:19 EST
	- Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 104.24 seconds
- No host is running :(
