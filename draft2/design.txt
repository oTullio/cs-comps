Bleeding Privileged Credentials From the Heart
Oliver Tullio and Michael Xia

This project is primarily focused on prying open the heartbleed vulnerability, a bug in the widely used open source software OpenSSL. Using Heartbleed, an attacker can access privileged data such as session cookies from a server, which in our example gives access to a database containing improperly encrypted credentials. 

Brief steps:
Use Heartbleed to dump server memory containing session cookies
Use session cookies to log in as unprivileged user
Use unprivileged access to extract encrypted data from a database
Brute force crack open database on local machine to acquire root credentials
